There is no stopping the mighty Sorcerer and in the autumn of 2023 the band will release their highly anticipated fourth album entitled ‘Reign Of The Reaper‘. Again not content with repeating themselves the album features some of the darkest, heaviest and most aggressive material the band has ever recorded, and at the same time some of the most lyrical and beautiful.
<br/><br/>
For the opening track and first single ‘Morning Star‘, the band showcases their proficiency in fusing classic metal with other heavy elements with quite a few twists and turns along the way. With a bombastic rhythm section spear-headed by Evensand and Biggs, to the melodic and brilliantly executed guitar work of Niemann and Hallgren, culminating with the ferocious Engberg, whose voice soars, ‘Morning Star‘ takes the listener on a relentless journey through the kingdom of Pandemonium.
<br/><br/>
Sorcerer are also known for their long title tracks with catchy and highly memorable choruses, and the second single ‘Reign Of The Reaper‘ is no exception. Taking the listener through the realms of death and dread, this doom-laden epic with it’s many twists and turns will crush souls, leaving metal fans begging for more darkness and despair.
