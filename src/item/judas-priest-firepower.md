This is a very well written album. Rob Halford's vocals on this album sounds as though he had recorded it in his younger years with the band, notably the "British Steel" era. The guitar solos from Tipton and Faulkner are very well composed and really have a striking 80's era feeling. The drumming ranges from fast to slow to mid-paced which at times makes it predictable when the guitar solo would kick in. Firepower is about 58 minutes long, but time moves fast when listening to it; and once its over you're left yearning for more. Most of the songs are very memorable thanks to the majestic guitar work from Faulkner and Tipton and of course Halford's absolutely commanding vocal deliveries.

Songs such as "Firepower", "Traitors Gate" and "Spectre" happen to be my favorites on an album in which every track competes to be the best. Most of the album is mid-paced with "Firepower "being the fastest track on the record. Personally, I think Halford's screams sound better on slower tracks. The album closes with "Sea of Red" which begins with an acoustic guitar and gracefully builds towards the end with the electrical guitar being introduced.

Overall the album is an excellent entry into an already prodigious catalog by a band that refuses to step down from the throne. "Firepower" serves as both a special release for the die-hard Judas Priest fans and newcomers now discovering the band. I am absolutely looking forward to the next album Judas Priest has to offer the metal world given the stunning musical performance displayed on "Firepower".
