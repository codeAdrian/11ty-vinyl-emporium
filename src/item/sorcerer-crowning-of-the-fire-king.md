For the most part, Sorcerer’s second full-length album picks up right where 2015’s "In the Shadow of the Inverted Cross" left off. In addition to featuring an equally lofty title, The Crowning of the Fire King preserves the epic doom template as well as the polished production job, melodic yet mysterious guitar leads, building drums, and cleanly delivered baritone vocals. But rather than completely repeating the formula of that long-awaited debut, Sorcerer’s follow-up is somehow even more epic.

What really makes Sorcerer unique compared to their peers is the absolute lack of melancholy in their music. The lyrics may contain fantastic tales of war and oppression but the delivery has a triumphant, determined tone rarely found in epic doom.

There are excellent songs on here. With the possible exception of the mid-tempo riff friendly “Sirens,” “Crimson Cross” is probably the most accessible track of the lot thanks to its particularly memorable chorus. The title track is also the album’s strongest long-running number as the choral vocals toward the end result in the album’s most effective climax.
<br/><br/>
The Crowning of the Fire King sees Sorcerer further developing their triumphant brand of epic doom, resulting in an album that requires more patient listens than their debut but may ultimately offering a greater reward. Songs may run together but the professionalism and strong performances of the members keep this from feeling played out. It is nice to see Sorcerer refusing to rest on their laurels and I hope they have their best work still to come.
