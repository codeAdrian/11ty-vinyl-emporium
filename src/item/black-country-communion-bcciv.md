Listening to Black Country Communion’s latest offering "BCCIV" is akin to a religious experience. It’s monumental and grand work, bludgeoning at times, and expansive at others, full of power and passion, heavy riffs, massive and meaty hooks, and enough melodies to make a minstrel weep. And it gets better with each play.
<br/><br/>
Opener "Collide" is all about the sudden impact and the riff, it sets a cracking pace and allows each of the four BCC members to display their impressive individual chops, which of course are all the more impressive collectively. There are a number of other rockers of course on "BCCIV" from the highly commercial stomp of "Over My Head" to the Classic Rock of "Sway" and the sweeping emotion of "Love Remains". And whilst the rockers are all more than impressive it’s the more expansive tracks that leave you in awe.
<br/><br/>
Of those epics Bonamassa’s "The Last Song For My Resting Place" with its Celtic notes, mandolin and fiddle and dark centre, is wondrous, enticing and beautifully full and rich. And if you enjoyed that one "The Cove" will have you shaking your head in disbelief – it’s an incredible rendering, full of power and passion before being set fully alight by Joe’s guitar. The album closes with two songs that kind of sum this very focused and immensely rewarding album: the beautifully honed solid rock of "Awake" and the cascading beauty and delicacy of "When the Morning Comes" which rides a great Bad Co-like groove and takes it into the stratosphere – it’s heady stuff indeed.
<br/><br/>
I’ll end with a quote from the Voice of Rock himself who said of BCCIV “I wanted the new album to physically shake your soul. It’s a wake up call.” It’s also the best of BCC so far in our humble opinion.
