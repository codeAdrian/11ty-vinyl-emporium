As a tribute to late AC/DC guitarist and founder Malcolm Young, that he is credited as a songwriter on every single song on Power Up is magnificent. But what’s greater is that – even with the tragic loss of the man with the heaviest right hand in all of rock’n’roll in 2017 – AC/DC have made an album that, even for them, is a high-voltage celebration of life, the best of times, and the absolutely indomitable, boundless power of a couple of chords and a four-four beat.
<br/><br/>
As ever, Power Up sounds like AC/DC, while also managing to sound like its own record. Opener "Realize" is a classic starting banger that builds on a one-two riff before Brian Johnson – reinstated after his exit from touring due to hearing issues – screeches his way magnificently into view. "Rejection" has an electrifying Angus Young Guitar Solo, "Shot In The Dark" has hot picking and a massive chorus, "Demon Fire" is a sleazy stomper that feels a bit like Whole Lotta Rosie but not as fast, "Code Red" chops out heavy blues that sees Angus’ fingers duck-walking all over his fretboard, and "Witch’s Spell" is one of those ’DC tracks that’s probably in its element two-thirds of the way through a wedding reception. And it’s all so marvellously right.
<br/><br/>
It’s never been the point for AC/DC to do anything ‘new’, just to do more of it. That’s why they do it, and that’s why they’re the best at it. And that’s why we love them. But more than ever, Power Up is a reminder that this music has a power that belies its apparent simplicity (and here do not mistake this for being easy – go stand in a practice room and listen to how many drummers can’t do the ’DC beat properly).
