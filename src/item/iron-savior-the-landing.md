"The Landing" is one of Iron Savior’s best albums to date featuring dynamic guitar riffs, excellent song-writing, and bombastic harmonies with synths just in the right places. Piet Sielck is also sounding better than ever, with his raspy yet soaring vocals leading the charge on this new disc, and let’s not forget the wonderful backing vocals of all the other members of the band, plus the choir-like chorus’ Iron Savior is renowned for.
<br/><br/>
One of the biggest of killer tracks on the disc just has to be the swift and catchy homage to the history of heavy metal, “R.U. Ready”. The song not only flows brilliantly, but also contains references to legendary bands and songs from way back when, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Deep Purple, Judas Priest, Steppenwolf and Rainbow. To all those bands who made metal and rock what it is today, we salute you.

Another absolute killer track is Iron Savior’s metal hymn, the sensational “Heavy Metal Never Dies”. Quite melodic and extremely catchy, Sielck’s passionate and almost hypnotic vocals, sends this track to the top, with the soaring and sing-a-long chorus (and the solo) the biggest highlights by far. The pulsating “Hall of the Heroes” has that grinding power chord riff that you can’t help but move your head to.
<br/><br/>
‘The Landing’ also has Iron Savior’s old-school signature speedy tracks, with their typical rapid fire guitar riffs, double bass and piercing vocals. Always consistent from the very start, you just can’t go wrong with Piet Sielck and the team from Iron Savior. ‘The Landing’ is just further proof that they are one of the best headlining European power metal acts in the world today and all fans, not just of the band but also power metal, should jump on this immediately as you won’t regret it.
